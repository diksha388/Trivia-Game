#1# Project Description=
The Trivia Game is a blockchain-based decentralized application (dApp) that allows players to answer trivia questions and earn rewards in the form of cryptocurrency. The game is powered by a Solidity smart contract deployed on the Ethereum network. The contract owner can add trivia questions with multiple options and a reward for correct answers, while players can submit their answers and claim rewards for correct responses.

#3# Project Vision=
Our vision is to create an engaging and rewarding platform where users can test their knowledge, compete in trivia challenges, and earn cryptocurrency. By leveraging blockchain technology, we ensure fairness, transparency, and security for all participants.

#4# Key Features
- **Decentralized Ownership:** The contract is controlled by an owner who can add questions and manage the reward pool.
- **Reward Pool Management:** The owner can deposit funds into the reward pool, which is distributed to players for correct answers.
- **Multiple Choice Questions:** Each trivia question has multiple options, and the correct answer is stored securely on the blockchain.
- **Player Balances:** Players can accumulate rewards for correct answers, which can be withdrawn at any time.
- **Transparent Gameplay:** All questions, answers, and transactions are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and trust.

#5#Future Improvements
   **Dynamic Question Generation: Introduce AI-driven algorithms to generate questions dynamically, ensuring a continuous supply of fresh content.
    **Community Governance: Implement mechanisms for community voting on new questions or reward distributions.
    **Progressive Difficulty Levels: Add questions with varying difficulty levels and adjust rewards accordingly.
    **Time-Limited Challenges: Include timed challenges for players to earn additional bonuses.
    **Cross-Chain Compatibility: Expand the contract to support multiple blockchain networks for a wider reach.
